Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Using LSTM

Overview
This project focuses on time series analysis and prediction, specifically for stock market data. Time series data, which is a sequence of data points indexed in time order, is prevalent in many fields, making it a crucial aspect for data analysts and scientists.

In this notebook, we explore stock data from several major technology companies: Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Using the yfinance library, we fetch historical stock prices and perform a range of analyses, including risk assessment based on historical performance. Additionally, we predict future stock prices using a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model.

Key Questions Addressed:
Price Change Over Time: How have the prices of the selected stocks changed over time?
Average Daily Return: What is the average daily return of these stocks?
Moving Average Analysis: What are the moving averages for the stocks over different time periods?
Project Workflow
Data Collection:

Use the yfinance library to fetch stock data for Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.
Visualize stock prices using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Data Analysis:

Analyze the stock prices over time.
Compute the daily returns to measure stock performance.
Calculate and plot the moving average of stock prices.
Risk Assessment:

Evaluate the historical risk of stocks based on performance volatility.
Stock Price Prediction:

Implement a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
Requirements
To run the notebook and reproduce the results, the following libraries are required:

bash
Copy code
pip install yfinance
pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib
pip install tensorflow
How to Use
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-analysis-lstm.git
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook stock-market-analysis-prediction-using-lstm.ipynb
Run the cells to fetch stock data, analyze stock performance, and predict future prices.

Results
The LSTM model provides future stock price predictions based on the historical data of the selected technology stocks. The predictions help illustrate the potential future movements in stock prices.
